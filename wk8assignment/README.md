REFLECTIONS
Started off with planning by making my wireframe for what i want to build and how i want it to look. Got overwhelmed and confused when trying to think of how many tables i would need for the database. Talked it through with Manny and he confirmed what I was think is correct, and it would be two - one for books and one for reviews, which would have a one to many relationships.
After planning the tables, also in figma, I then went into SQL and started creating the tables and inseting the data according to my plans.
When inserting data into tables, SQL would error. Went through the asistant debugger - inserting the code and error to determine the cause, got confused by the error so asked Manny and he pointed out the problem was that I was inserting data into the table for reviews, but hadnt used the ids to link the reviews to the corresponding books. After asking him to explain how it worked, I understood that i needed to go back into the reviews and add the corresponding book id to the reviews to link them. I then tried to select and join them but the query errored. Used the assistnat debugger again and it showed me the issue was with the query - i had written the select, and join as seperate queries when they actually need to be one. Corrected the code, and it ran with no issues.
With my tables linked, I turned my attention vs code and set about creatintg a scratch, and adding in all the demo code from the week which i thought would be revelant for the project.
